## About contributions
This project is developed for personal and educational purposes. Feel free to explore and use it to enhance your own learning in Rust and algorithm.

Given the nature of the project, external contributions are not actively sought nor encouraged. However, constructive feedback aimed at improving the projects (in terms of speed, accuracy, comprehensiveness, etc.) is welcome. Please note that this project is being created as a hobby and is unlikely to be maintained once my initial goal has been achieved.
